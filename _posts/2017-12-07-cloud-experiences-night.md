**Infrastructure as code with Terraform**

Every major platform, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure,Google Compute Engine (GCE) or OpenStack offers dozens of APIs to control the infrastructure, such as compute (virtualized or bare metal), storage, networking, and networking services (e.g. firewalls). We will discuss the benefit of provisioning the infrastructure written as code without using any GUI. This talk will feature a live demonstration of installing from the scratch Kubernetes cluster on OpenStack with Terraform.
