This year I still had the chance to go to the KubeCon Europe 2019 in Barcelona.
It was like last years at European event in Copenhagen, a mix of announcements around the CNCF, the Kubernetes community and very good user experience feedback by Spotify, Zalando and more. The service mesh was another subject with a lot of presentation and is starting to be used in production.

It was also very interesting to see how things have progressed, especially in the cloud native storage space.

If you want more details, check out the presentation below that summarizes the main announcements at keynotes and the presentations I followed.
